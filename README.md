# zotero-export
This is a Python script used to upload PDFs of articles in Zotero straight to Dropbox online.

# Things to note:
- You must have Zotero locally installed and synced with the cloud. This script uses pyzotero (https://github.com/urschrei/pyzotero) so please follow those instructions available opn their page.
- You must create an API key for Dropbox (https://blogs.dropbox.com/developers/2014/05/generate-an-access-token-for-your-own-account/). You do not need Dropbox installed locally.
